abstract ={
<b>Background:</b> Automated pathology techniques for detecting cervical cancer at the premalignant stage have advantages for women in areas with limited medical resources. <b>Methods:</b> This article presents EpithNet, a deep learning approach for the critical step of automated epithelium segmentation in digitized cervical histology images. EpithNet employs three regression networks of varying dimensions of image input blocks (patches) surrounding a given pixel, with all blocks at a fixed resolution, using varying network depth. <b>Results:</b> The proposed model was evaluated on 311 digitized histology epithelial images and the results indicate that the technique maximizes region-based information to improve pixel-wise probability estimates. EpithNet-mc model, formed by intermediate concatenation of the convolutional layers of the three models, was observed to achieve 94&#37; Jaccard index (intersection over union) which is 26.4&#37; higher than the benchmark model. <b>Conclusions:</b> EpithNet yields better epithelial segmentation results than state-of-the-art benchmark methods.
